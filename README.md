The Indian Railways (IR) carries about 5.5 lakhs passengers in reserved accommodation every day. The Computerised Passenger Reservation System (PRS) facilitates the booking and cancellation of tickets from any of the 4000 terminals (i.e. PRS booking window all over the countries). These tickets can be booked or cancelled for journeys commencing in any part of India and ending in any other part, with travel time as long as 72 hours and distance up to several thousand kilometres. In the given project we will be developing a website which will help users to find train details, enquire about trains running between given two stations, book tickets and know the exact rates of their tickets to the desired destination. With the help of online booking people can book their tickets online through internet, sitting in their home by a single click of mouse. Using their credit cards people can easily get their tickets done within minutes.
